 * Enter to insert a new paragraph — RtInlineRoot has no paragraph node
 * and the live-site renderer would lose the second paragraph anyway.
 *
 * Both plain Enter and Shift+Enter insert a soft line break (LineBreakNode)
 * instead. This keeps the form's dirty-state in sync (the previous
 * "swallow plain Enter" behaviour broke the save flow when Enter was the
 * user's first keystroke — no state change → never dirty → Save button
 * stayed disabled).
