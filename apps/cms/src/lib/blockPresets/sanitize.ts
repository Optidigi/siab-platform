/**
 * Lazy schema-drift handler for block-preset insert.
 *
 * Given a stored preset's `data` object and the slug of the block-type the
 * preset claims to be for, walk the LIVE block field config and copy
 * through only the values whose key matches a known field. Unknown keys
 * are dropped silently — that's how we tolerate field renames or removals
 * across upstream block-config changes without a migration framework.
 *
 * What we deliberately do NOT do:
 *   - Inject defaults for newly-required fields. The user fills them in
 *     after insert; the page-save validator catches any that stay empty.
 *   - Rename old keys to new ones. There's no version stamp on stored
 *     presets, and bare-knuckle rename mapping invites footguns. Renames
 *     are operator-driven; if/when one happens, ship a one-shot
 *     `scripts/rewrite-preset-data.mjs`.
 *   - Validate referenced media IDs exist in the current tenant. Payload's
 *     own `upload` field validation fires on the next page save and
 *     surfaces broken refs there, which is cheaper than a per-insert
 *     tenant-media query.
 *
 * Recursion targets the same field shapes used in `src/blocks/*.ts`:
 *  - `group`     -> object subtree
 *  - `array`     -> array of row objects (each row's shape mirrors the
 *                   field's `fields`)
 *  - `blocks`    -> array of objects keyed by `blockType`; we recurse
 *                   into the matching sub-block's `fields`
 *  - `row`       -> presentational wrapper, no key in data — flatten
 *  - `collapsible` -> presentational wrapper, no key in data — flatten
 *
 * Anything else (text, textarea, number, select, upload, relationship,
 * checkbox, date, json, code, email) is a leaf — copy through. JSON
 * fields with `admin.editor === "richTextBlock" | "richTextInline"`
 * carry RtRoot trees but are still leaves to the sanitizer; the structural
 * RtNode validation happens elsewhere (validateAgainstManifest on save).
 *
 * Pure, no side effects, no React. Safe to import on the client (block
 * configs are plain JS).
