/**
 * Block presets — tenant-scoped, reusable templates for one configured block.
 *
 * The user picks a Hero (or any other block) on a page, fills in its fields,
 * then "saves as preset" so the same shape can be inserted on another page
 * pre-filled. The picker filters by `blockType` so a Hero preset only ever
 * inserts as a Hero.
 *
 * Storage: `data` is a single jsonb column carrying the verbatim RHF values
 * for one block (sans the synthetic `.id` RHF adds). We do NOT mirror the
 * block's nested Payload schema here — that would double maintenance and
 * break any time we touch a block. Trade: no admin-UI editing of preset
 * internals; recreate-on-change is the MVP path.
 *
 * Immutability: once a preset is saved, `data` is locked (field-level
 * `access.update: () => false`). Operators can rename / re-describe via
 * the standard collection update path, but not edit the preset body. This
 * sidesteps "what if my page's block diverged from the preset" semantics.
 *
 * Tenant scoping: handled by `multiTenantPlugin` (see `payload.config.ts`).
 * Tenant-shared, not per-user: a preset is visible to every tenant member
 * with `canRead`. `createdBy` is recorded for attribution but not used for
 * access control.
 *
 * Hooks: deliberately NO `afterChange: [projectPageToDisk]`. Presets live
 * in the DB only; they don't project to per-tenant disk artefacts.
