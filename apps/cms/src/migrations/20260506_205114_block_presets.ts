/**
 * Wave 2 — `block-presets` collection (tenant-scoped reusable block templates).
 *
 * Schema mirrors what `pnpm payload migrate:create` would have produced for
 * the new collection: a `block_presets` table with a `data` jsonb column,
 * tenant FK with ON DELETE CASCADE (matches the post-Wave-2 invariant from
 * `20260505_202447_cascade_tenant_delete`), and a `created_by_id` FK with
 * ON DELETE SET NULL (so deleting a user doesn't take their saved presets
 * down with them).
 *
 * Also adds `block_presets_id` to `payload_locked_documents_rels` per
 * Payload's per-collection convention; without this, the admin UI's
 * document-locking machinery throws when you try to save/edit one.
 *
 * Snapshot (`.json`) was hand-augmented from the previous migration's
 * snapshot (Docker wasn't running locally at authoring time, so
 * `migrate:create` couldn't autogen). Future `migrate:create` runs will
 * diff against this hand-written baseline; verify no spurious drift on
 * the next collection change. Pattern matches the hand-edit note in
 * `20260505_222023_grow_site_settings`.
