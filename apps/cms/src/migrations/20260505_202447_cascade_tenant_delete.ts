/**
 * Wave 2 — switch the four tenant-scoped collections AND `users_tenants`
 * from `ON DELETE SET NULL` to `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `tenant_id`.
 *
 * Why pages/media/site_settings/forms: with SET NULL, deleting a tenant
 * orphaned its content — rows kept living in the DB with `tenant_id = NULL`,
 * invisible to the tenant-scoped admin views and indistinguishable from
 * "no-tenant" rows. Track 1 prod smoke test exposed the leak.
 *
 * Why users_tenants: Wave 1's auto-generated migration created a contradictory
 * pair — the column was `NOT NULL` but the FK was `ON DELETE SET NULL`. So
 * any `DELETE FROM tenants` failed at the FK trigger ("null value in column
 * tenant_id violates not-null constraint") BEFORE the plugin's afterDelete
 * cleanup hook could run. CASCADE is the right semantic anyway: deleting a
 * tenant should remove every user-tenant association entry pointing at it.
 * The plugin's cleanup hook becomes a no-op for the users side after this
 * (its UPDATE-with-filter still runs but matches zero rows post-cascade).
 *
 * Cascade semantics are correct because every row in these tables is
 * conceptually owned by exactly one tenant. The only thing that intentionally
 * survives a tenant delete is the `users` row itself (super-admins exist
 * tenant-less; non-super-admins lose their tenants[] entry but the user
 * record itself stays so it can be re-assigned).
 *
 * Up:
 *   1. Drop the existing SET NULL FKs.
 *   2. Re-add as CASCADE.
 *
 * Down: the inverse — drop CASCADE, re-add SET NULL. Note that re-running
 * `down` restores the original Wave 1 mismatch on users_tenants; that's
 * faithful inverse but means the original tenant-delete bug returns.
